# Trust PCs - Simple online PC parts store

This is the first real large project We have started. It is intended to be a simple online PC parts store. Users should be able to add items to cart and to "wishlist" and complete the transaction. Admins should be able to add, edit and delete offers directly on the website. There is planned dark and light mode.
